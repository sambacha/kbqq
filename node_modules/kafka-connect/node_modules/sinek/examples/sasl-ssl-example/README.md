# SASL-SSL-Example

- start the zk+broker combo [here](../../kafka-setup): `yarn run kafka:start`
- run `node producer.js` and wait until the producer is connected and sending (as the broker will have to create the topic during the first start)
- run `node consumer.js` to receive the produced messages

> use debug mode to see mo information, e.g `DEBUG=* node producer.js`
